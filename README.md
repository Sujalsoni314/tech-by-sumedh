Tech By Sumedh — Ready React + Tailwind Starter
===============================================
What's included:
- React + react-scripts app scaffold
- TailwindCSS config + PostCSS
- Framer Motion + React Router
- Pages: Home, About, Projects, Articles, Contact
- Dark/Light theme toggle, typing animation, ad placeholders

How to run (on your PC)
-----------------------
1. Extract this folder.
2. Open terminal in the extracted folder.
3. Run: npm install
4. Then: npm start
5. Open http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- If your system has previous tailwind issues, you can skip running any global tailwind commands — this project uses local packages.
- To enable production build: npm run build
- For contact form production, add your Formspree/Getform endpoint into src/pages/Contact.jsx (FORM_ENDPOINT constant).

Support:
If anything fails during npm install or start, copy-paste the terminal output and I'll help fix it.
